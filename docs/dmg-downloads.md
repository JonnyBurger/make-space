## Available platforms

- macOS

## Command

Removes all .dmg files from the Downloads folder.

DMG files contain applications, which you usually move into the Applications folder.

For example, when you download Slack and open the DMG file, it asks you drag and drop the Application into the Applications folder.

After you've done that, the DMG files remains in the Download folder and is redundant.

Normally deleting .dmg files from downloads is low-risk because you can redownload them from the internet.

We still advise you to check your Downlods folder before you execute this strategy.
